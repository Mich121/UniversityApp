UniveristyApp is web application, it is divided into two parts backend API and frontend which connect with backside.<br/>
Thanks application you can look at data from different models, for instance: Student, Lecturer and Department. On this models you can make<br/>
CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete). Access to this data is possible only after log in, if you do not have account you should<br/>
register in system. Passwords are hashed so we are safe :) Without having account only one page is accessable - main page...<br/>
Student model is the most extended, because additionaly apart from CRUD operations you can:<br/>
- search objects by name using search bar<br/>
- create fake student after clicking button student object create automatically, it gets name and surname from external API<br/>
- create many student using JSON file, system has function that parse files with student data (name, surname, departmentId)<br/>
